# Real-estate-All
Final data Science Project

Gathering all data from 99acres.com and Preprocessing all that Data
by Data Cleaning, EDA and Feature Selection to get a Refined data from
Raw unfiltered data, making it suitable for model training and evalutaion.

From that refined data, Applied various Machine Learning Models for 
various sections, like Recommendation Engine, Predictor System, and basic Analysis 
and Insights board along with it, in the Streamlit web app, provding useful and 
real world specific Information to the audience.

Evaluated and applied various models in Machine Learning, like SVM, Randfom Forest,
